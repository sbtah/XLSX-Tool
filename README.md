# XLSX-Tool
My project of xlxs tool for stufff related to my job.

The main idea is load a data from xlsx file and then instanciate a class of an article from given row in xls. 
Right now article class have a few functions, that I use in Excel daily.
Whole idea is to load a generated xlsx file and then prepare a new one from it that will have new columns and calculations I need.
In future there is a posibility to make this a full fledged tool that will analize and prepare orders.
